# branch_prediction
Branch predictor simulator to evaluate different configurations of branch predictors

This project was a part of course ECE 563 (Microprocessor Architecture) at NC State University under Dr. Eric Rotenburg.

This project implemented 3 configurations of branch predictors:
1. Bimodal Branch Predictor
2. Gshare Branch Predictor
3. Hybrid Branch Predictor (was a combination of Bimodal and Gshare predictor models)
